## Abstract

Emotional classification in text has many applications in different domains, and social media
has become a popular domain for research in
this area. In this research paper, we present
a study that aims to evaluate the effectiveness
of different linguistic feature sets for multilabel emotion classification in Reddit text. We
developed lexical, syntactic, and semantic feature sets, then tested the ability of different
machine learning models, such as SVM, XGBoost, Random Forests, Logistic Regression,
and KNN, to classify emotions based on various combinations of these feature sets. To
evaluate the performance of our models, we
used several metrics, including micro F1 score,
hamming loss, subset accuracy, multilabel accuracy, and a novel metric that we developed,
called Balanced Multilabel Performance (BMP)
Score. Our findings indicate that the combination of syntactic and lexical features was
the most important for emotion classification.
Our best-performing models achieved Multilabel Accuracy and Micro F1 scores of 89.03%
and 0.5891, respectively. Our study showcases
the efficacy of linguistic feature sets and machine learning models for emotion classification in textual data, while emphasizing the need
to evaluate model performance using multiple
metrics.
